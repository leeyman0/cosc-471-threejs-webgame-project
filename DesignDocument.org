* What Are We Going to Do?
  We are going to create a game about rotating/moving an object in
  order to fit it into a moving pane. The panes come faster as
  difficulty increases, and the holes get smaller (but not impossible
  to fit into â˜º)

** Controls
   
*** Scheme 1
    - Q, E --- rotate counter/clockwise around depth
    - W, A, S, D --- standard movement controls
    - <, > --- rotate around height

*** Scheme 2
    - Arrow keys --- move shape
    - E, D --- rotate around depth
    - W, S --- rotate around width
    - Q, A --- rotate around height
 
* How Are We Going to Do It?  
** How are we going to generate the shapes?
   Good question. The plan is to model a single shape at first in order
   to test the abilities of our program. Then later, we will make a shape
   algorithm to select a shape.
** How are we going to generate the holes?
   Using subtractive geometry. First, we will generate a silhouette of
   the 3D shape that the user controls from a random angle.

   Then, subtract the silhouette in a random place in a vector rectangle,
   hollow out some more according to difficulty. Then extrude the rectangle
   to get the hole.
   
** How is the difficulty going to increase?
   The hole will get smaller, and the pane will get faster.

\section{What Are We Going to Do?}
\label{sec:org6ddc32c}
We are going to create a game about rotating/moving an object in
order to fit it into a moving pane. The panes come faster as
difficulty increases, and the holes get smaller (but not impossible
to fit into â˜º)

\subsection{Controls}
\label{sec:orgac249ab}

\subsubsection{Scheme 1}
\label{sec:orgeab2c53}
\begin{itemize}
\item Q, E --- rotate counter/clockwise around depth
\item W, A, S, D --- standard movement controls
\item <, > --- rotate around height
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Scheme 2}
\label{sec:org9031708}
\begin{itemize}
\item Arrow keys --- move shape
\item E, D --- rotate around depth
\item W, S --- rotate around width
\item Q, A --- rotate around height
\end{itemize}
\section{How Are We Going to Do It?}
\label{sec:org0b47907}
\subsection{How are we going to generate the shapes?}
\label{sec:orgdf8c868}
Good question. The plan is to model a single shape at first in order
to test the abilities of our program. 
\subsection{How are we going to generate the holes?}
\label{sec:orgf6ff5df}
Using subtractive geometry. First, we will generate a silhouette of
the 3D shape that the user controls from a random angle.

Then, subtract the silhouette in a random place in a vector rectangle,
hollow out some more according to difficulty. Then extrude the rectangle
to get the hole.

\subsection{How is the difficulty going to increase?}
